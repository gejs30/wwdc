# After many attempts, I tried playing back audio from files included in other online tutorials, to test if the issue was on my end. Other external files did not play either. 
Therefore, I'm not sure whether this failed due to incorrect code on my part or because I had no way of testing if the audio worked. 
Another possible explanation from Reddit is that I accidentally fried the speaker somehow...
