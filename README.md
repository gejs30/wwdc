# Ikea Hacked Medication Reminder LED Lamp

Using the Circuit Playground Express module (CPE) and a ‘hacked’ Ikea lamp, this prototype would light up at specific times to remind the user to take their medications on a twice daily basis. At each alert time, the CPE would play a reminder audio clip along with a shift in its regular light pattern. 

In its current form, the prototype is not as far along as I had hoped. There were some issues that prevented me from considerable progress which I will touch upon in my reflection. While the prototype lights up and remains consistently powered “on” and stable throughout the day, it lacks the complexity of the original goal. Despite, MANY hours of experimentation. 

Listed in this repository is evidence of attempted changes over time.
